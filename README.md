# TODO PostgreSQL

## Description

#### Running the Apollo Graphql Server

To run the project, you will need Docker and Docker Compose installed onto your machine. Docker Compose was used to handle test data.
I have provided a link as to how to install docker and docker compose below.

[Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

```sh
1 npm i
2 npm run serve
```
Doing this will open the port 4000. The graphql api can be accessed on `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
I have left further instructions as to how one can populate the database within the back-end README.md file.

##### Basic Structure of Server

The back-end was built with GraphQL (in combination with Express) and PostgreSQL Database.
